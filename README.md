# pluto-charon-simulation
This simulation demonstrates the unique mutual tidal locking between Pluto and Charon! 
Here's what you'll observe:
Key Features:

Colored surface features - The red dot on Pluto and cyan dot on Charon show their rotations
Barycenter - The yellow dot shows where they actually orbit around (not Pluto's center)
Real-time stats - Track the synchronized periods

What the simulation shows:
Condition 1: Charon's rotation = Charon's orbital period

Watch the cyan dot on Charon - it always faces toward Pluto
This is typical tidal locking (like our Moon)

Condition 2: Pluto's rotation = Charon's orbital period

Watch the red dot on Pluto - it always faces toward Charon
This makes the system mutually tidally locked (very rare!)

Physical Significance:

From Pluto's surface, Charon appears motionless in the sky
From Charon's surface, Pluto appears motionless in the sky
They're like cosmic dance partners, always facing each other
The orbital period (6.387 Earth days) equals both rotation periods

This mutual tidal locking is unique in our solar system - no other planet-moon system has this perfect synchronization where both bodies always show the same face to each other!
